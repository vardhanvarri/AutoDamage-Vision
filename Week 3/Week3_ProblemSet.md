# Week 3 – Problem Set (CNNs, Encodings & Localization)

---

## Problem 1 (Easy)
What is an *image encoding*?  
Why are raw pixel values generally a poor encoding for visual recognition tasks?

---

## Problem 2 (Easy)
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) captures edge information.  
Why is edge information useful for recognizing objects in images?

---

## Problem 3 (Medium)
Early convolutional layers in CNNs often learn edge-like filters.  
Explain why this happens and how it relates to hand-crafted features such as HOG.

---

## Problem 4 (Medium)
CNN embeddings usually separate image classes better than PCA applied to raw pixels.  
Give two reasons for this improvement.

---

## Problem 5 (Hard)
YOLO predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from convolutional feature maps.  
Explain why learning *spatially-aware embeddings* is essential for object detection, and why a pipeline based only on global image embeddings (e.g., PCA + classifier) would fail.
