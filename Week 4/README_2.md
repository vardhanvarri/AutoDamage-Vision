# Week 4 – Training & Evaluating an Object Detection Model

## Learning Goals
- Train an object detection model on real-world data
- Understand the full training pipeline
- Learn how object detection models are evaluated
- Perform qualitative and quantitative error analysis

---

## What This Week Is About
This week transitions from **understanding object detection** to **building a complete system**.

You will:
- Prepare a dataset for training
- Train an object detection model
- Evaluate model performance
- Analyze failures and limitations

This week is **not about achieving high accuracy**, but about understanding *why models behave the way they do*.

---

## Model Choice
- **YOLOv3** was used in Week 3 for conceptual understanding
- **YOLOv8** is used this week for training due to its clean and stable training pipeline

The underlying ideas remain the same.
