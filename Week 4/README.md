# Week 4 – Training & Evaluating an Object Detection Model

## Learning Goals
- Train an object detection model on real-world data
- Understand the end-to-end training pipeline
- Learn how detection models are evaluated
- Analyze model failures and limitations

---

## What You Will Learn
This week focuses on moving from **inference to training**.

You will learn:
- How annotated datasets are used for training
- The difference between training and inference
- What a detection model learns during training
- How to evaluate object detection models correctly

This week is **not about achieving high accuracy**, but about understanding the process.

## Tasks
- Prepare a small training dataset subset
- Train the object detection model
- Evaluate the trained model
- Perform qualitative error analysis

---

## Submission
- Training notebook(s)
- Evaluation outputs (metrics and images)
- Short written reflection on model behavior

## Key Takeaway
Training a model is only the first step.  
Understanding **why it succeeds and fails** is the real learning outcome.
